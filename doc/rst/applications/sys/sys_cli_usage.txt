USAGE:

   ecal_sys  [-c <Path>] [--remote-control] [--remote-host <Hostname>] [-s]
             [-x] [-r] [--local-tasks-only <true|false>]
             [--use-localhost-for-all-tasks <true|false>]
             [--no-wait-for-clients] [--disable-update-from-cloud] [-i]
             [--interactive-dont-exit] [--] [--version] [-h]


Where:

   -c <Path>,  --config <Path>
     The Configuration file to load. Not supported in remote-control mode.

   --remote-control
     Remote control another eCAL Sys instance.

   --remote-host <Hostname>
     Set the hostname for remote-controlling.

   -s,  --start
     Start all tasks.

   -x,  --stop
     Stop all tasks.

   -r,  --restart
     Restart all tasks.

   --local-tasks-only <true|false>
     Only tasks on local host will be considered. Not supported in
     remote-control mode.

   --use-localhost-for-all-tasks <true|false>
     All tasks will be considered as being on local host. Not supported in
     remote-control mode.

   --no-wait-for-clients
     Don't wait for eCAL Sys clients before starting / stopping tasks.
     Waiting is always disabled in interactive and remote-control mode.

   --disable-update-from-cloud
     Do not use the monitor to update the tasks for
     restarting/stopping/monitoring.

   -i,  --interactive
     Start eCAL Sys and listen for commands on stdin. When not in
     remote-control mode itself, eCAL Sys will offer the eCAL Sys Service
     for being remote-controlled. Note that eCAL Sys will exit, when stdin
     is closed. To prevent that, combine this option with
     "interactive-dont-exit". When using interactive mode, waiting for
     ecal_sys_clients is disabled.

   --interactive-dont-exit
     When in interactive mode, this option prevents eCAL Sys from exiting,
     when stdin is closed.

   --,  --ignore_rest
     Ignores the rest of the labeled arguments following this flag.

   --version
     Displays version information and exits.

   -h,  --help
     Displays usage information and exits.

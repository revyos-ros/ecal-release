   :widths: 20 80

   * - Wire compatibility
     
     - * eCAL UDP: 100% compatible
  
       * eCAL TCP: 100% compatible

       * Services: 100% compatible

       * eCAL Shared Memory: Downwards compatible to eCAL 5.10 and eCAL 5.9

         The eCAL **header of the eCAL SHM file** has been expanded.
         Old eCAL versions contain a bug that will prevent them to read the new memfile header.
         This bug has been **fixed in eCAL 5.10.2 and 5.9.10**; those versions will just ignore the new settings and communicate nevertheless.

         *eCAL versions 5.8 and earlier will unfortunatelly fail to receive SHM data from eCAL 5.11 publishers.*

         The **SHM Monitoring layer** has been added in eCAL 5.11 and can therefore not be used with any older eCAL version.

         - Old ecal_rec_clients will ignore the setting
